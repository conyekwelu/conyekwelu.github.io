# thoughts on contract law in the ride sharing space

From my earlier (small) training in contract law, a valid contract requires 3 things: an offer, an acceptance, and some consideration. Most transactions include a simple purchase at a local market take this form. The beautiful thing however is that the contract must not be written — it could be expressed verbally. So let’s say you hail a taxi in V/I — “Oga take me to Ikeja” (*the offer*). The *baba* responds “I will go but only if you pay me N3,500” (*conditional acceptance*). If you enter the taxi, you have implicitly agreed to the contract.

An anecdotal example from one of my professors involved a taxi ride in Israel. He entered the cab only disclosing his destination to the driver without negotiating the fare. Upon arriving at the destination, the driver tells him that the fare is 2,500 shekels. He makes a counter offer of 2,200 shekels and before he can say “hot potato”, the driver applies the central lock and speeds through the streets returning him to the point of pickup. Both parties are back to *status quo ante* sans some lost time and fuel used up.

With most ride — hailing apps (Taxify, Uber) however, this simple contract becomes more complex. In fact you could make the argument that not one but two contracts exist:

- A contract to be conveyed from one location to the other between the passenger and *the platform!*
- A contract between the driver and platform agreeing to convey *any assigned passengers* to *any destination* (usually unknown at the point of pickup) for a given fare.

From this you can see how two contracts govern any given transaction and the implications. If a driver decides to eject a passenger from his vehicle, he is not in breach of any contract with **the passenger** and has no liabilities or obligations for the reason that *no contract exists!* The passenger unfortunately would have to seek recourse from the platform who would also seek to enforce breach terms against the *errant* driver.

Clearly for users of these services, it would be useful for these platforms to provide more information on the rights of users and what to do when one leg of the contract is breached as happened in the case that inspired this piece.
