# summary: the mundanity of excellence

> “great generals rise quickly” ~ Carl von Clausewitz

this idea also holds true in the academia

excellence — “consistent superiority of performance”

it does not result from:

- personality characteristic i.e. not oddballs or weirdos or social deviants
- quantitative changes in behaviour i.e. increasing training time or number of reps
- special inner quality aka talent

it requires qualitative differentiation — tweaking and perfecting techniques, competing and training in other schools, eating healthier, strengthening weak areas, training at competition intensity

different levels of a sport are qualitatively different. dimensions include:

- technique
- discipline — with diet, sleep, warmups, energy management and **technique execution**
- attitude — enjoy hard practices at higher level, see training as meditation

beyond an initial improvement of strength, flexibility and feel there is little increasing accumulation of speed (mastery) through sheer volume. quantitative changes *do* bring success but only *within* levels in a sport.

changing worlds (vision) is a major step towards excellence. compare i am going to be compete in IBFF as a black belt vs i am just going to take training one day at a time.

> “people don’t know how ordinary success is” ~ Mary T Meagher

new techniques, new habits, new challenges

superlative performance (excellence) is a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon , which have been drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. motivation is also mundane — social rewards and doing for doing sake.

win practice races or sparring to build confidence. above all maintain the sense of mundanity in competitions.

an example of inability to maintain the sense of mundanity is the failure to finish the doctoral thesis — hopeless struggle for the *magnum opus*.

in summary, there is no secret. there is only the doing of all those little things, each done correctly time and time again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit — an ordinary part of one’s every day life.

every time a decision comes up, make the qualitatively correct choice.
