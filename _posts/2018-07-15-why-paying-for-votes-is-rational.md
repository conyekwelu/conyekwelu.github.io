# why paying for votes is rational

Let’s borrow some models from economics and how firms compete. Specifically we will look at three ways in which firms compete — price (Bertrand game), quantity (Cournot game) and product differentiation (Hotelling).

### **Bertrand**

In Bertrand competition, firms compete on price and the goods are usually homogeneous. If firms in the industry have the same cost structure, then equilibrium will happen at Price = Marginal Cost. But because firm’s don’t have the same cost structure we have industry leaders that are low cost producers. Same with Nigerian politics. Nigerian politicians are all alike but their pockets are not the same. Result — the highest paying politician wins.

Price contains information. Suppose two politicians A and B offer N4,000 and N5,000 to voters respectively, conditional on having NO other information about the candidates and their policies, what can you infer? I’d suggest four possibilities:

- B cares more than A for the voters hence the higher offer
- B cares more than A about being in office
- B has deeper pockets, or
- some combination of all three

At least, we can agree that the weighting of the first inference is non-zero.

### Cournot

Here firms compete on quantity. If we both overproduce, prices crash just like in the market for oil. Eventually, and similar to Bertrand, low cost producers will exit. Basically, If politician A offers one bag of rice politician B will offer two bags. We arrive at similar conclusions as under Bertrand. This also assumes homogeneity of goods (both votes and politicians).

### Hotelling

Now this is where it gets interesting. Here firms compete by differentiation on some dimension. Consider the market for breakfast cereals. Firms (Nasco, Kelloggs etc) compete for a share of consumer’s breakfast spend by creating different products from the same base ingredients of sugar and flour . So you have low- sugar cereal targeting the health conscious adults and regular h̶i̶g̶h̶ ̶s̶u̶g̶a̶r̶ cereal for kids. The goods are heterogeneous and so the competition is not as fierce on Price.

Why is this important? because this is how startups can gain a foothold or newbies overthrow incumbents. If you cannot compete with an incumbent based on “Price”, you have to innovate and compete based on differentiation (you know how Buhari was packaged in the last election? Yeah). This is also the premise of the cost quality frontier — choose one end of the frontier and play there. This means that if I am a new politician, without deep pockets, I should spend my time thinking about how to differentiate.

Now there can be good differentiation and bad differentiation. Good differentiation could mean more availability (e.g. Kingsley Moghalu making a lot speeches reminiscent of 1st republic campaigns) or some investments in the community (e.g. Atiku establishing a University — [normal plug for my candidate](https://medium.com/@TheIgboBandit01/a-seers-prediction-on-nigeria-s-eventual-route-to-redemption-a831bedab792)). Bad differentiation on the other hand could be ballot box snatching or the use of violence and coercion (experienced first-hand by yours truly while presiding over a polling booth in 2007).

### **Conclusion**

So why does cash for votes make sense?

- It is a market-driven solutions in an area where violence is an alternative (similar to drugs, organs trade and prostitution etc).
- It is difficult to convert individual preferences into a community — wide ranking. Therefore, subject to a limited budget, cash for votes is one way you can efficiently target the preferences of the most members of the community.

Does this mean that the candidate with the deepest pocket wins? Clearly not as evidenced by the last presidential elections. Aspirants can differentiate.

Finally, if you were going to share cash as a politician when should you share it? Every year? Four years before the election? two years? six months? a week? Here psychology research provides us with the answer in the [Recency Effect](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/decision-making/recency-effect/). Subject to a budget constraint, give them their *mullah* right at the polling booth!
