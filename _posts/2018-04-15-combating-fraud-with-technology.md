# thoughts on fraud (corruption) and technology

Once in a while, I crawl out of the wood work I inhabit to opine on matters I don’t understand. Today, I will use a simple frame work to evaluate part of the statement expressed below, i.e., that Technology can end corruption in Nigeria. If you run a small business [think restaurant or bar], this frame work might be useful for how you think about fraud.

Our hypothesis for testing: (whole thread is useful for context)
I will start with definitions because a wise man once said stealing is not corruption and a nation was in uproar. And also because corruption is a vague word. I will use the word “Fraud” in this write up to mean corruption, stealing or any other variants. To avoid straw-manning, I will define fraud as either of misrepresentation or misappropriation.

You can think of misrepresentation as when you falsify financial reports claiming more revenue or inventory than you have. Or applying for a contract and falsifying the application documents to look eligible [like some waste management companies :)]. This will not be the focus of this post.

Misappropriation, on the other hand, is when you take something that does not belong to you or use something in an unapproved manner. For example, you transfer government money to a personal account (theft)in the Cayman. Or you collect mobilization fee on a project and vanish into the thin air! Basically, stealing or theft and many cases of public corruption in Nigeria would fall under misappropriation.

Now we are warmed up. Forensic experts tend to look at fraud using the a simple framework called the Fraud Triangle (see below). I think it is reasonably robust but can make no claims that it is exhaustive. Let’s look at it and then evaluate how technology affects each of the factors.

*insert image of fraud triangle*

#### The Golden Triangle
**Incentives (or Pressure):** Another wise man once said, “there are only a few forces more powerful than incentives”. If your security man has a very sick daughter and needs a lot of money for her treatment — Incentive! If your shop manager needs to pay his rent but has no money — Incentive! If the price of petrol in the neighboring country is 50–100% higher than your subsidized price — Incentive!!

Simply put, if the benefits of an action (gate-man stealing your diesel) outweigh the real costs (buying hose and gallon) and probability weighted potential costs (getting caught and arrested) — then a strong incentive exists. Sadly, there’s not much you or technology can do about this.

**Rationalization:** When you think about rationalization, think culture, environment or tone at the top. It is about how individuals justify fraud using their internal moral compass. For example, if you visibly underpay your employees (or owe them salary for months) they will rationalize stealing your diesel. If you, as Oga, sanction unethical actions (e.g. “accountant, transfer N50,000 to that my babe and record it as operating expenses”), do not be surprised when your employees rationalize fraud as their share of the organizational pie. Note that the environment could be a given e.g. it may be culturally acceptable to take stuff that does not belong to you because [a] the owner is richer than you are, or [b] it is “our” oil money. Here again, there’s not much of a role for technology.

**Opportunity:** Opportunity is about access. A petty cash officer has access to the till and can steal some for him/herself. Organizations deal with the opportunity dimension using “Controls” — another jargon that basically means “rules”. To give some examples — you could have a rule that petty cash should never exceed N20,000 thus limiting the theft opportunity to that amount. You could have controls for approvals, tenders board etc or to split duties (preventing a single individual from having too many powers). They could also be physical controls such as security men to prevent asset theft or even passwords to restrict access to systems. **The Treasury Single Access (TSA) system was about minimizing access.** Controls do not necessarily have to do with technology [but you can implement some with technology].

#### Conclusion

Any of the factors alone is sufficient to enable fraud. If all three are not managed, you can bet your last dollar that some fraud is going on. We also see from looking at the factors that only 1 of the 3 appears to be *directly* affected by technology.

We can therefore conclude with a few takeaways (that forensic folks have always known):

- Fraud is more about the individuals and the environment than the technology.
- When there is “collusion” (two or more control gatekeepers come together to steal yo bread), fraud happens. No controls or technology will change that. (Common examples — procurement officer and vendor, loan officer and borrower, contractor and tenders board etc.)

I believe the main role of technology will be transparency with the hope that more transparency will create some kind of deterrent. Transparency in the sense that an audit trail is created. Hence, ex post we can review the records, reconcile with physical assets and tell if misappropriation [or corruption] has occurred.

Unless of course the Big Chief was talking about advanced stuff like Distributed Ledger Technology (aka block-chains) but that is a conversation for another day.
