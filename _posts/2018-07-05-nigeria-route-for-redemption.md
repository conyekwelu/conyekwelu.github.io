# a seer’s prediction on Nigeria’s eventual route to redemption

Nigeria is currently stuck in an [Idea Trap](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2004/Caplanidea.html). There is some difference of opinion on where salvation will come from. Some hope in a heaven that will come from a [long-term systematic and deliberate plan ](https://aguntasolo.co/destiny-organising-principles-396ffd92f5b1)to organize people around a set of principles. Others yet believe salvation lies in the here and now, that with your PVC we can put Nigeria on track with the election of a technocrat (e.g. Kingsley Moghalu) come 2019 or 2023.

I am here to propose a third alternative.

Firstly, we need to diagnose the problem for what it really is. After that we can look at how we can break out of the current equilibrium and if any of these proposals can do that effectively.

### Who will bell the cat?

We have a strong case of the Collective Action problem and the Free- rider problem. The collective action problem refers to a situation multiple people would benefit from an action, but the cost of the action is too much for each and any individual. Of course coordination problems (losses) also increase with the size of the group. The other side of the coin is the free-rider problem which as the name implies involves nonparticipants benefiting from your actions without sharing your costs e.g. chilling at home like non-Nigerians while [Oby Ezekwesili protests killings alone](https://www.icirnigeria.org/photos-oby-ezekwesili-embarks-on-one-woman-march-to-protest-plateau-killings/).

My issue with both earlier paths is in their odds for success. Organizing millions of people across tribes and geographies behind a set of principles is no mean feat([E go hard oh!~ Ken Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem), 1963).

Technocrat wild cards on the other hand have:

- very low probability of success (defeating the incumbent)
- no clout with the system (recall Dr Okonjo-Iweala’s struggles as coordinating minister including the famous 50 questions episode)

Now for what I see as the path of least resistance for the Nigerian situation.

### The K-Group

Within any group, there most usually is a sub-group (or *k-group, as my former lekturer Prof. Ian Shapiro calls it)* for the whom the benefit of taking action outweighs the costs ***irregardless of free riders!\*** This group however has to be sufficiently small that they do not suffer coordination losses and can make and act on big decisions quickly.

In every estate in Lagos, there must be one or two “big men” for whom the risk of not having a security man at the main gate is so great that they would voluntarily cover the cost even if no one else contributes (thank me later!).

You can describe the k-group decision condition as:

E(Cost of Taking Action) < P(Successful Action) x E(Benefit from Taking Action)

### Lessons from South Africa

To see something similar closer to home, we can see look at the underappreciated role of business in resolving a troublesome equilibrium (apartheid).[1]

In 1988,[ Anglo-American ](http://southafrica.angloamerican.com/)together with De Beers controlled about half the entire capitalization of the JSE; the top five corporate groups together controlled over 80 percent (**A natural k-group**). Under the apartheid regime, businesses were accumulating significant profits as the economy was uncompetitive due to the high concentration.[1]

Financial instability resulting from international pressure and domestic protests led to a debt crisis in 1985 with many US bank refusing to roll over loans. Short term private capital flows were negative for a decade from about 1983 (**potential costs of not taking action**).[2]

The business leaders were also smart enough to worry about the (anticipated) end of apartheid. As one of the leaders put it

> “I woke up one day and realized : We don’t have to be Cuba; we can be Brazil!”

You see at the time, the ANC was getting donations from Russia & Cuba and had strong leanings towards [communism](https://youtu.be/jl_CTBYHQsk?t=402) as the party ideology (**potential costs of not taking action**).

Here are some the ways they influenced outcomes. They:

- organized themselves into a pressure group called the Consultative Business Movement (CBM) which grew to over 100 business by 1989.
- made connections with the liberation movement [3]
- persuaded government to talk to the liberation
- contributed about R46 million to a business election fund to ensure elections were perceived to be free and fair.

Well, they succeeded… Anglo’s global revenues today are north of $28billion (not about to dive into what portion is generated in SA but you get my drift).

### Implications for you

According to Albert Hirschman in his seminal treatise [Exit, Voice and Loyalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) (another interesting post on this [here](https://aguntasolo.co/exit-voice-and-loyalty-aviation-in-nigeria-8d9e738240da)) we have three choices with which to respond to a situation of deteriorating quality. Simply we can choose one of Exit, Voice and Loyalty.

If you are not a member of the *k-group*, and cannot play the “games they play” a rational choice would be to **Exit**. Why? for the simple reason that individual cost to you of taking action **outweighs** the expected benefits to you (after considering your probability of success). As an individual P(Successful Action) is infinitesimally small. To put it as Nassim Taleb does,

> “to succeed, you must first survive”.

Else you may be ground down and made weary and miserable by the same problems that wrinkled the brows of your fathers and mothers. Of course that is if something else does not get you first — like a burning tanker.

**What does this mean for Nigeria?**

Let’s do a similar exercise for Nigeria to determine its k-group.

Question:

> “If Nigeria turns into a failed state today, who stands to lose the most?”

I joke I joke!

However in jokes there are still some truths. I will end this piece with a few thoughts:

- for change agents — you cannot do it on your own but you can use your “**Voice**” to nudge any identified k-group with whom you have influence to act in self preservation by advocating for the right policies. Already the #NotTooYoungToRun group are starting to do this successfully.
- for non change agents — Think hard! and maybe do the needful and apply for Canadian PR before they change mind. Apply for F-1, B-1, whatever , (actually feel free to reach out on twitter @Theigbobandit01 if you need advice on emigrating as a graduate student)
- personally (and hopefully some people who will read this and have their PVCs), **I will be rooting for Atiku in 2019**. I spent sometime thinking about this (some of it shaped by a conversation with former Gov. Peter Obi earlier this year). We need someone who owns businesses and employs labor and most importantly has **skin in the Nigerian game**. The alternative will be rooting for Dangote for President.

Let’s have business men organize this economy for a change.
